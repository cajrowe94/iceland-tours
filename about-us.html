					<h3>Ingólfur Arnarson<span> the first permanent settler of Iceland.</span></h3>
					<p>Our inspiration and mission come from Iceland's first permanent settler. Arnarson was a legendary explorer that 
						founded Reykjavik in the year 874. We found his story to be truly inspiring and historically significant.
						Arnarson and his wife left everything in pursuit of a new life and new land. Iceland proved to be that new beginning and they remained her for the rest of their lives. By naming our tour company after Ingólfur, we aim to inspire our clients and give adventures like no one has ever experienced. Our guides will bring you to remote and deep places that give you that primal, adrenaline rush.<br><br>
						We started way back in 1967, having only one guide and 2 bus drivers. From there we grew our fleet and hired on more and more guides, slowly getting to the point we are at now. Our founder, James Lucas, is a native Icelander and is currently still living here in Reykjavik. He checks in quite often and makes sure his company is running smoothly and his customers are happy. Help us make Arnarson Tours the best tour company to ever explore Iceland!
