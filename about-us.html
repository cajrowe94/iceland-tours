					<h3>Ingólfur Arnarson<span> the first permanent settler of Iceland.</span></h3>
					<p>Our inspiration and mission come from Iceland's first permanent settler. Arnarson was a legendary explorer that 
						founded Reykjavik in the year 874. We found his story to be truly inspiring and historically significant.
						Arnarson and his wife left everything in pursuit of a new life and new land. Iceland proved to be that new beginning and they remained her for the rest of their lives. By naming our tour company after Ingólfur, we aim to inspire our clients and give adventures like no one has ever experienced. Our guides will bring you to remote and deep places that give you that primal, adrenaline rush.<br><br>
						We started way back in 1967, having only one guide and 2 bus drivers. From there we grew our fleet and hired on more and more guides, slowly getting to the point we are at now. Our founder, James Lucas, is a native Icelander and is currently still living here in Reykjavik. He checks in quite often and makes sure his company is running smoothly and his customers are happy. Help us make Arnarson Tours the best tour company to ever explore Iceland!

						<h4>Timmy Inkling</h4>
						<p>Timmy is a veteran around these parts. Everyone in Iceland knows him as "Two-Timer Timmy", because he can practically run
							two tours at the same time! Timmy specializes in South Shore guides and loves to show clients the beauty of the black 
							beaches.<br><br>Timmy has 3 kids, which he calls his "little trekkers" and has named each of them after volcanoes native to Iceland.
							Talk about dedication, eh! Also, don't make Timmy Boy angry.. he likes to get wild with that icepick. Ole boy can be crazy!</p>

						<h4>Balter Shmitty</h4>
						<p>Balter is a sort of "wonder child". Rumor has it he dropped his office lifestlye in the U.S. to come here and pursue a tour guide career. We're glad he did! Balter knows exactly how to connect with any group of people and can get everyone laughing in any situation. He's been with us for 2 years and has boosted sales through the roof.<br><br>Fun fact for you: Balter can race down these Icelandic hills on a longboard at 100+ mph. He's a nut! His clementine cake is also killer.</p>

						<h4>Bill Gore</h4>
						<p>Where do we even start with ole Bill? He's a genius, comedian, and excellent cook. Bill can have 20+ steaks whipped up in under a half hour. We don't know how he does it! We first saw Bill during his time on <i>Jeopardy</i>, and he later came to visit Iceland, and never left! Bill has devoted his life to Arnarson's Tours and vowed to put his life on the line for his co-workers and his clients.<br><br>A side note; we don't actually know if Bill's top half of his head exists. You'll never see him without his beanie! Probably to hide that alien, superhuman brain of his!</p>

						<h4>Frankie Muus</h4>
						<p>Frankie, Frankie, Frankie. Not only is his mustache a work of art, but his guide skills are even better! Frankie is our most requested tour guide and continues to lead the pack here at Arnarson's. Frankie spends every waking minute studying the land and planning bigger and better tours for the clients. This man is a LEGEND.<br><br>Don't be worried if Frankie is doing something dangerous.. juggling four mangoes on the tip of Dyrhólaey is just second nature for him!</p>
